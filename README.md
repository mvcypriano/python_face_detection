Face detector with pauses using haar cascade and dnn. For use in a rpi, haar cascade are prefered, because of pi's low processing power. It is configured to only count as detected faces at a certain size (close to the camera). It only saves the image, so that this image can be used by other application.

It requires python-opencv

The use of python 3 is preferred, although the applications will work on python
2.7 with little modification.
